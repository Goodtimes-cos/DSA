# Object-oriented programming
## Procedural programming
In procedural programming, the focus is on creating "procedures" that implement our program logic.
We pass data objects to these functions, those functions perform operations on the data, and then
potentially return a result to be used by the caller.

In procedural programming, the functions and the data those functions operate on are separte entities.
The programmer is responsible for combining the functions and the data together to produce the desired
result.

## What is Object-oriented programming?
In object-oriented programming, the focus is on creating program-defined data types that contain both
properties and a set of well-defined behaviors.
