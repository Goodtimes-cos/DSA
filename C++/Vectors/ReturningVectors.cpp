/* The term copy semantics refers to the rules that determine how copies of objects are made. 
 * When we say a type supports copy semantics, we mean that objects of that type are copyable, 
 * because the rules for making such copies have been defined. When we say copy semantics are 
 * being invoked, that means weâ€™ve done something that will make a copy of an object.
