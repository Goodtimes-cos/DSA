"""
Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph
as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which:
 - form a tree that includes every vertex
 - has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed 
 from the graph

We start from one vertex and keep adding edges with the lowest weight until we reach our goal.
The steps for implementing Prim's algorithm are as follows:
    1. Initialize the minimum spanning tree with a vertex chosen at random,
    2. Find all the edges that connect the tree to new vertices, find the minimum and add it
    to the tree,
    3. Keep repeating step 2 until we get a minimum spanning tree
